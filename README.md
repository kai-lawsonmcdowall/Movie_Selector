# Movie_Selector
A little Rshiny app I created for fun to filter through a small database of ~1600 20th Century films by Year, Length, and film Genre. 
The original dataset was taken from data.world:

The file I've uploaded is a "cleaned" version of the original, and the first section of runs on the original to produce "cleanfilms". 

The app is called rather ambitiously called "Oceanus", After the name of the first titan in Greek Mythology. Admitedly,  I didn't start with an end product in mind, 
but just wanted to dive into the learning process :)
